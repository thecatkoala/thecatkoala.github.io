    <h1>City to Summit</h1>
    <img src="images/website-image.png" alt="city and mountain silhouette" />
    <p>City to Summit organizes and leads outdoor excursions for youth living in the city to explore their regional wilderness! Focus is on providing
        experiences for kids to places and time outdoors that otherwise are not accessible opporutunities to youth living in the city.</p>
        <p>Not every child or family has equal access to being able to get outside and spend meaningful time in nature. City to Summit partners with schools and 
        various organizations to faciliate adventures large and small for kids to get outdoors and learn more about the natural environment in which they live.</p>
        <p>These opportunities allow kids to interact with nature, participate in fun and new outdoor activities and hopefully learn some enviornmental stewardship along
            the way! Much growth and respite can be found with time spent outside and we believe all kids should be able to discover the natural world for themselves.</p>

     <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/mthood/">Mount Hood National Forest</a></li>
